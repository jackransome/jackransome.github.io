        <h3>The Complication of Genetically Coded Social Reward</h3>

        <p>
          Understanding how our genomes could possibly encode the structures
          that detect when to punish us for pain, and when to reward us for
          sweet tastes, is relatively simple. There are special-purpose
          receptors for both categories of stimuli, which can be wired to a
          specific location in the brain, as is routine with other bodily
          functions, with only minimal processing required. Many more abstract
          aversions and goals can then be built on top of this through learned
          structures that, for example, learn to associate a steep increase in
          perceived temperature, with pain coming in the near future. Aversions
          have a contagious nature, resulting in this learned connection
          creating an aversion to this steep increase in temperature, and in
          turn the organism may learn an association between the visual stimuli
          of a flame, and that steep increase, creating a new aversion, and so
          on. This fractal tree of connections which aversions and desires flow
          through (sometimes even contextually, based on other signals like
          hunger, or more abstract world states), can be understood as stemming
          from simple genetically encoded pain and pleasure in response to
          signals from purpose-built sensors, plus relatively simple learning
          rules that propagate these aversions and desires to learned higher
          abstractions over time.
        </p>

        <p>
          For many social rewards that are (presumably) encoded within our
          genome, however, the story must be more complicated. If different
          social behaviors are indeed encoded to be intrinsically rewarding,
          such as courting behavior, status seeking, nurturing, and norm
          enforcement, then there are no specialized status receptors or
          hardcoded norm violation detectors. The detection of the world states
          corresponding to these goals relies on many layers of abstraction
          machinery learned through experience, that can even vary based on
          culture and experience. Take social status for example: picture
          someone stepping out of a limousine onto a red carpet, wearing a
          tuxedo and being greeted by hundreds of people all trying to take
          pictures of you. Now picture the same scenario except with a van
          instead of a limousine, an orange jumpsuit instead of a tuxedo, no red
          carpet, but still the swarm of photographers. The differences here are
          quite far abstracted from raw sensory inputs, and interpreted through
          a cultural lens (what vehicles and attire are used for what roles,
          what a red carpet means), and yet one clearly signals high status, and
          the other signals the opposite. Now, much of this can be explained the
          same way that fearing a flame is explained, through a world model that
          propagates aversion or desire from an intrinsic reward function, to
          more abstract world states. But what is the intrinsic reward function
          for social status?
        </p>

        <p>
          One possible story is that the concept of social status as an abstract
          goal emerges completely organically from much more primitive rewards,
          such as regulating body temperature, avoiding pain, and eating.
          Perhaps because early in life all of these needs are fulfilled by
          parents, the abstract concept of having things done for you is imbued
          with the valence of satisfying these core biological needs, and then
          this "Other people doing things for you" node acts as if it was an
          intrinsic goal itself, leading naturally to modelling social
          hierarchies and associating high valence to higher positions in them.
          I'm not willing to totally discount this narrative, at least when it
          comes to some fraction of human social behavior, but it doesn't seem
          to explain absolutely everything, for example nurturing your children,
          and other animals show examples of social behavior that cannot come
          about in the way I described.

        <h3>The Universality Hypothesis</h3>

        <p>
          Chris Olah's universality hypothesis states that different models
          converge on the same internal structures when being trained on the
          same domain. First, this was shown for convolutional neural networks,
          showing that different CNNs learned the same types of filters, but
          more interestingly, these filters also match what our brains are doing
          in visual processing, building edge and colour detectors, then
          building more abstract feature detectors on top of these building
          blocks, and so on. Research by Anthropic has found strong evidence of
          universality across language models too, finding meaningful features,
          such as
          <a href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/2023/monosemantic-features"
            >the Arabic script feature, and the DNA sequence feature, that exist
            across models</a
          >. If universality applies between brains, then we should expect to
          find very similar learned structures that correspond to the same
          concepts, including social concepts, in most brains. Each human's
          "training data" is quite different, depending on where you grew up,
          who your friends and family are, and your genetics, so we should only
          expect to see universality in the structures responsible for
          interpreting only the most universal of human experiences, one of
          which would be the basics of social interaction: you live in a world
          which contains other human beings, who are intelligent, have their own
          goals, and regularly interact with you.
        </p>

        <p class="image-caption">
          Examples of very similar types of features being found in multiple
          different CNNs
        </p>

        <p>
          Now, across neural networks, even ones with identical architectures,
          features that are found in both are rarely found in the identical
          position, as a result of differences in random weight initialization.
          These differences grow when you stack differences in architectures,
          hyperparameters, order and augmentation of data, and data itself.
          Biology is
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemihydranencephaly"
            >no more controlled</a
          >
          than this, so we can't assume that universal features would be built
          in the same locations across all brains.
        </p>

        <img

        <p class="image-caption">
          MRI of a man missing half a brain hemisphere, described as
          "functioning normally" in daily life
        </p>

        <p>
          So the same structures for detecting and representing highly abstract
          concepts such as specific social situations are likely to form across
          brains, but not in the same location. This makes it impossible for a
          genome to simply code for reward structures to appear in an exact
          location in order to code for social rewards. How else may it be done?

        <h3>Neural Cellular Automata</h3>

        <p>
          <a href="https://distill.pub/2020/growing-ca/"
            >Neural cellular automata</a
          >
          (NCA) are cellular automata similar to Conway's game of life, except
          that the update rule for the cells is determined by a neural network.
          By training the rule network on each pixel of an image, it learns a
          complex rule that updates the cell differently in different
          situations, to recreate the image it was trained on. The resulting
          process is analogous to differentiation of living cells in
          multicellular organisms: They all contain the same genome, and yet the
          way that the genome specifies different responses to different
          surroundings and inputs results in different cells playing very
          different roles which in aggregate form large and complex structures
          made of distinctly different parts.

          An example of a neural cellular automata where the rule was trained on
          an image of a gecko. Note that the update rule for every cell is the
          same, and the differentiation is emergent, stemming from differences
          in the local environment of each "cell".

        <h3>Tying It All Together</h3>

        <p>
          NCA provides the solution to the problem of creating reward circuitry
          that links into universal features, wherever they may appear in the
          brain. If these universal social features appear across brains in
          different locations, and are implemented in very similar ways, then
          there will be some configuration in the brain that can be reliably
          "recognized" by an NCA-style rule, which then builds the required
          structure around it, implementing reward circuitry which provides
          intrinsic rewards for highly abstract concepts that are learned, not
          directly coded in the genome.
